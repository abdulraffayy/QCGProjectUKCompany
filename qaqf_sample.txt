The QAQF framework represents a transformative approach to academic quality assessment, integrating nine distinct characteristics across a spectrum of nine progressive levels. This framework is specifically designed to measure and evaluate educational content and learning outcomes in contemporary higher education environments.

Key principles of the QAQF framework include:
1. Comprehensive coverage of foundational knowledge and understanding
2. Application of critical thinking and analytical skills
3. Integration of digital technologies and AI capabilities
4. Emphasis on sustainability and ecological consciousness
5. Development of creative and reflective practice
6. Encouragement of futuristic and innovative thinking

The framework is structured to allow precise measurement of educational quality from basic implementation (Level 1) through to 21st Century Innovative implementation (Level 9), providing educators and content creators with clear guidelines for development and assessment.
