Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This field has revolutionized how we approach data analysis and pattern recognition.

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning - Learning with labeled examples
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error

Applications:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
